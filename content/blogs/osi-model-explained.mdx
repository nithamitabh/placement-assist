# OSI Model Explained

The **OSI Model** (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network communications between different systems. It divides the networking process into seven distinct layers, each with specific functions.

## The Seven Layers

1. **Physical Layer**  
   Responsible for the transmission and reception of raw data bits over a physical medium.

2. **Data Link Layer**  
   Handles error detection, correction, and framing. Ensures reliable data transfer between two directly connected nodes.

3. **Network Layer**  
   Manages logical addressing and routing so that data can be sent from the source to the destination across multiple networks.

4. **Transport Layer**  
   Provides reliable data transfer, flow control, and error recovery. Protocols: TCP, UDP.

5. **Session Layer**  
   Manages sessions or connections between applications.

6. **Presentation Layer**  
   Translates data between the application layer and the network. Handles encryption, compression, and translation.

7. **Application Layer**  
   Closest to the end user. Provides network services to applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).
